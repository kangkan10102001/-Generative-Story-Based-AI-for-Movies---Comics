# Generative Story-Based AI for Movies or Comics

## Overview
Generative Story-Based AI for Movies or Comics is an AI-driven application that generates storyboards, plots, or scripts based on user input. It optionally creates simple visuals for comic panels, enabling creators to bring their ideas to life seamlessly. This project utilizes GPT-4 for plot generation, a GAN-based model for visual creation, and a web interface for user interaction. It is implemented in Jupyter Notebook, leveraging deep learning frameworks such as Hugging Face Transformers, DALL·E, and Stable Diffusion.

## Features
- **Story Generation:** Uses GPT-4 to generate movie or comic plots based on user prompts.
- **Character and Scene Creation:** Generates character descriptions and scene settings dynamically.
- **Comic Panel Visuals:** Employs a GAN-based model (e.g., DCGAN, StyleGAN) to create basic comic illustrations.
- **Web Interface:** A user-friendly front-end for input and visualization.
- **Real-Time Editing:** Users can modify generated scripts and visuals interactively.
- **Export Options:** Supports exporting scripts and images in various formats.

## Technologies Used
- **Language Model:** GPT-2 (via Hugging Face Transformers)
- **Image Generation:** DALL·E, Stable Diffusion, [GAN Model Name] (e.g., DCGAN or StyleGAN)
- **Frameworks & Libraries:**
  - Python (NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch)
  - OpenCV for image processing
  - Flask for backend web development
  - Jupyter Notebook for development

## Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/generative-story-ai.git
   cd generative-story-ai
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
1. Open `story_generation.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Enter a short description or prompt for the story.
3. Run the script to generate a plot and visuals.
4. Modify or refine the generated content as needed.
5. Export the final output in text or image format.

## Applications
- Screenplay writing and pre-production storyboarding.
- Comic book creation and concept art.
- AI-assisted content generation for creative storytelling.
- Interactive fiction development.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrating voice-based story prompts.
- Improving AI-generated visuals for more detailed illustrations.
- Adding support for multiple comic styles.
- Enhancing user interface for seamless interaction.
