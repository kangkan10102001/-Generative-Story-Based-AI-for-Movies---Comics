Write a plot for a futuristic sci-fi movie about AI.

The plot of the movie is that a computer is programmed to make a decision based on the information it receives from the human brain. The computer then makes a choice based upon the data it received from its brain, and then it makes the decision. This is called a "decision-making" process. It is a process that is based in the brain and is not based solely on information. In other words, it is an algorithm that makes decisions based only on what it has received. For example, if you have a robot that can make decisions, then you can choose to have it make the decisions. But if it doesn't make those decisions then the robot will not make them. So, the computer will make its decision, but it will still make it. And that's the way it works. If you want to know what the future will be like, you will have to go through the process of making a prediction. That's what we call a Decision-Making Process. You can't just make an educated guess. There are many different ways to do that. One of them is to use a machine learning algorithm. Another is using a neural network. A neural net is basically a network of neurons that are connected to one another. They are all connected. When you make your decision you are making the same decision that you made when you were a child. Now, there are a lot of different kinds of neural nets. Some are very good at predicting the outcome of a situation. Others are not. We have some very bad ones. These are the kinds that we use to predict the outcomes of situations. I think that the best way to understand the neural networks is by looking at the behavior of their neurons. What they do is they are able to tell you what they think is going to happen. Then they can tell the story of what is happening. How they make their decisions is what makes them happy. Sometimes they will say, "I'm happy because I'm able, because of my brain." But sometimes they won't say that because they don't know. Or they might say something like "Well, I don' think I can do this." Or "Oh, well, maybe I should do something else." They might just say "No, no, we don', because we know that this is the case." And then they'll say it again and again. Eventually, they say they
